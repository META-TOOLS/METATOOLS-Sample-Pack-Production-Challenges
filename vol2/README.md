### Sample Descriptions:
##### Metaroom
These were created by randomly sampling bits and pieces of sound design and randomly adding effects to them with chain selectors!
##### Litevex
- `lost_piano_loop_120bpm`: A fm sine wave with a filter and pitch env ran through roar and hybrid reverb
- `lost_analog_saw_filter_120_cmaj`: A saw with added drawn on harmonics in Vital with subtly automated fine pitch, level, filter cut off and drive with a 24 db dirty filter effect playing a held arp with the filter cutoff being automated in the second part
- `lost_saw_chord_loop_120bpm_cmaj`: Parallel harmony chords with a saw in Serum with slight pitch and pan automation, added on harmonics and a slow attack envelope
- `lost_synth_one_shot_c`: A one shot of a saw in Serum with slight pitch and pan automation, drawn on harmonics and a slow attack envelope
- `lost_arp_120bpm_cmaj`: Serum saw pluck with drawn on harmonics and slight pitch and pan automation playing an arp
- `lost_night_chords_120bpm_cmaj`: Analog sine wave in Serum with short coarse pitch automation and chaos1 mapped to fine pitch playing a chord progression with inversions
- `lost_analog_sine_one_shot_c`: A one shot of an analog sine wave in Serum with short coarse pitch automation and chaos1 mapped to fine pitch
- `lost_analog_fifth_swells_120_cmaj`: Two layered slow attack sine waves with drawn on harmonics in Vital with different octaves, random pitch automation and a filter env playing a fifth

##### Pagliacci
I recorded all of these except for the break, which I took from another recording of drums. Everything else uses an old guitar in some way, even the percussion
##### laich
- `random_noise_bits`: random noise textures that kinda go rhythmic sometimes, made with Frequents "Sound Design 04: Serum" method
- `random_georgian_instruments_(playing_F,C,F#)`: old recordings of georgian instruments from a disc that just turned up somewhere in my parents house turned into "one shots"
- `noise_texture_pad`: textured pad made by using noise removal on a huge chunk of sound
- `noise_shakerish`: shakers also made from running a pad through a bunch of glitch stuff and then going to town on noise removal 
- `bad_correlation_drums_n_percs`: percussive stuff and drums made with a phase filter, not the best correlation but they're still fun
##### KVTzEH
- `ambient 120bpm`: this first one i made recording the raining directly inside my bathroom, as i remember i used some equalizer, adding a filter and toning down the pitch of the audio, stretching it a bit
- `taps 130bpm`: this one is actually funny, the original audio of it is me kinda snapping my fingernail that at the time was kinda big. used a tuned eq with a graphic eq below it, adding a bit of filter to make it sound more like a beat
- `pluck loop 120bpm`: last one i did using a gms preset as reference, tinkering with the sines aspect of it and of course adding some eq tuning over it to make it kinda smoothier
##### kiitzuna
- `pawluxae - c#maj`: put together a few different patches and washed it all in reverb to create a bit of a blurry, bittersweet atmosphere
- `lossy feedback neuro ( C )`: loss is in the name, but i think that the textures give it a very out there quality 
- `colourful synths`: bunch of vocoded sounds and patches run through shaperbox, i liked the progression- feels like the sitting on a roof durng a rainy night in a futuristic city type scene
- `bitcrush keys`: bit of a nostalgic melody and sound, not much else to say
##### ObsySlay
- N/A
##### IonKitty
- `e-piano-loop-1`: an e-piano loop i made. kinda fun? idk lol
- `delay-twinkle-texture-1`: a kind of twinkling texture i made by feeding a vital synth into a delay and convolution reverb, then into philodendron
- `cave-pluck-down`: a synth from xpand2 with tempo change going down, eq'ed, then sent into shaperbox for a bunch of panning and stuff, then a convolution reverb with a plucky chord in it
##### vinacom
- `lst_toypiano_texture_D_60bpm`: granulized texture made from a one second toy piano foley and HEAVILY processed in major maj7 
- `lst_freq_chords_180bpm_G`: freq modulated chords played on serum and processed with khs multipass
- `lst_dist_drumgen_160`: drum loop made w/ custom drumgen in phaseplant and processed with khs distortion and delay 
##### MELVINIZED
- `Vocoded pad w textures E minor`: was made by putting a lot of delay with automation on percussion. Then throwing it through a compressor, convolution and some reverb. After that i slapped a vocoder on it to make it sound better
- `Swing stutter 120bpm`: was mainly done By automating distortion and stuttering effects in a rhythmic way
- `Chopped guitars and rhythms - B minor 110bpm`: was made by layering instruments into a groovy loop and then putting gross beat on it
##### ntop
These are a bunch of lightly processed and curated snippets from recordings of interesting sounds I obtained by interacting with / hitting various items I found at good will:
- `toy_xylophone_sounds`
- `spatula_textures`
- `spatula_oneshots`
- `silver_bell_sounds`
- `gravyboat_textures`
- `gravyboat_oneshots`
- `drain_plug_sounds`
- `cup_textures`
- `toy_flute_bad_technique`
- `cup_oneshots`
- `assorted_accidental_noise`

These are the same as above, but specifically came from an adorable little soldered brass farm diorama THAT TURNED OUT TO HAVE A FREAKING MUSIC BOX INSIDE IT! I didn't even know there was a music box when I bought it!!! The music box claims to play `fly me to the moon`.
- `metalfarm_textures`
- `metalfarm_oneshots`
- `metalfarm_flymetoothemoon`

I produced these percussion one-shots by resampling the spatula oneshots from above and blending with a kick sub:
- `spatula_percs`
- `spatula_kicks`

I produced these by doing some heavy resampling and effects processing to my other samples.
A lot of these are based on the mudpie included below
- `drumloop_1_87_bpm_V2`
- `drumloop_lofi_unknown_bpm`
- `melodic_oneshots_5_4_180BPM`
- `mudpie`
- `weird_polyrhythm_9_4_180BPM`
- `weirdstabs_180BPM`
